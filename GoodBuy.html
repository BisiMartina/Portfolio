        <p> A project aiming to design the Smartphone application Goodbuy, which allows the sale, the purchase and the exchange of furniture and everyday-use items. It consists of a convivial tool, within the theme of circular economy.
        </p>
          
         <p> The project has been completed with the collaboration of 5 people for the Master’s course <span class="font-italic"> Laboratory of Interaction Design.</span> </p>

         <p> Within the project, we tackled the identification of the target and the needs of the users by means of a survey, analysed the competitors, designed the architecture of the application through card sorting,
            created the logo, the wireframe and an interactive prototype. Finally, we applied heuristic evaluations and user tests.</p>

        <h3> Concept</h3>    
        <p> Reflecting on the theme for our project, we started from my real-life experience abroad for the Erasmus+ Traineeship program.

            While abroad, I had to buy some furniture (e.g., lamp, cushions) to decorate my bedroom. However, I then wondered: what would happen to all the items I bought once I returned to Italy? My new friends suggested using dedicated WhatsApp groups to resell my items, but I feared I wouldn't have enough time to sell them before I left. </p>
            <p>Given these considerations, we have thought of creating an app that facilitates the exchange, purchase, and sale of household items among people who frequently change their residence (for work, study, or other reasons) and cannot take furniture and/or useful household items with them when they move. </p>

              <p> Our application aims to be an example of circular economy based on the reuse of materials and goods that are still in good condition, but also serves as a convivial tool that facilitates exchanges among people who travel and move frequently. </p>

    <h3>Survey</h3>
    <p> The first step was to gather demographic data, behaviors, and habits of people regarding the purchase and sale of second-hand items.
      More specifically, the goal was to identify the ideal target audience and understand if GoodBuy—with its features—could fully meet user needs, thus representing an innovation in the landscape of second-hand buying and selling apps.
    </p>

     <p> Two questionnaires were created: one in Italian and another in English. We chose to create an English version (you can find it  <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd8na79pb8BZiSt7Iu1uSd2PN31F9ylRs2IUMWnpns-1nKHvw/viewform" class="font-weight-bold">here</a>) because we aim to reach an international audience as well.
      For the English version, we relied on a native speaker for the translation, and a translator and linguistic mediator for the revision. 
    </p>

    <p>
      The questionnaires were created using Google Forms and distributed via WhatsApp, Telegram, and Instagram. 

      The responses received were respectively: </p>

      <p><div class="bubble font-weight-bold"> 107 </div> italian version; <span class="ml-4"> <div class="bubble font-weight-bold"> 36 </div> english version.</span></p> 
      
      <p>The questionnaire was designed to collect information anonymously and confidentially, in compliance with current regulations.
      During the analysis phase, the collected data was used exclusively for research purposes.
    </p>

                        <li>Loyalty: Vinted's community is already very developed, making it difficult to convince users to switch platforms, as they are accustomed to certain features and a specific interface.</li>

        <p> At this stage, we adopted the Card Sorting method, considered useful initially to observe and understand how users categorized the information available to them, and subsequently to confirm or restructure the app's information architecture. </p>

          <p>The Card Sorting – created online using the Miro platform – was administered to 6 participants: 3 men and 3 women aged between 23 and 33, representing different target groups (out-of-town student, Erasmus student, business traveler, and regular resident). </p>
          
        <p>Thanks to the selection of a heterogeneous sample of subjects, we were able to obtain a broader and more representative view of the mental models through which users tend to design information. </p>
